# Simulation code for covering time on 2D torus, explore its CLT

## Matlab code
First version of simulation, which contains unfounded error in the simulation of th covering time (The covering time simulated by .m file are usually half of that in the .c .py simulation). The Torus_cov.m file contains an interesting cartoon for the covering time 2D torus.

## C code
Use to simulate large ensemble of covering time. Use gcc -o CT  -D_DEBUG CT.c to switch to the debug mode.

## Python code
